# CompTIA-Security-plus
# My Security+ Notes & TryHackMe Labs

This repo is my personal study space for **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** and hands-on practice with **TryHackMe**.

---

## What’s inside

- **notes.md** – all my Security+ notes, like:
  - Security controls
  - CIA, AAA, Non-repudiation
  - Zero trust
  - Gap analysis
  - And more stuff I’m learning day by day

- **TryHackMe labs** – each lab has its own README with:
  - What I tried
  - Commands I used
  - Screenshots
  - What I learned
  - Which Security+ topic it is related to

---

## How I use it

- Read my notes to understand the concepts
- Do the labs to practice hands-on
- Document everything in the lab README so I can track progress
- Repeat, review, and learn more every day

---

## My Goal

- Pass **Security+** exam
- Get better at real cybersecurity stuff through labs
- Have all my learning in one place for reference
