# 2.1 Common Threat Actors and Motivations

First, a threat actor is an individual or a group that carries out a cyber attack, and their motivations vary from one to another.

- **Nation State / APT (Advanced Persistent Threat):**  
  Highly skilled, government-sponsored hacker groups. They work for the government and commit what the government wants.

- **Unskilled Attackers:**  
  Known also as script kiddies, these are beginner attackers who only have basic knowledge. They use ready-made tools and scripts, and their motivations are mostly having fun.

- **Hacktivist:**  
  They commit attacks for ideological and political motivations (e.g., Anonymous).

- **Insider Threats:**  
  Employees or contractors who misuse access. Their motivation can be anger or revenge.

- **Organized Crime:**  
  Hacker groups mostly motivated by money (e.g., ransomware attacks).

- **Shadow IT:**  
  Any use of technology, devices, or software in an organization without the approval of the IT department.

And finally, **chaos/disruption attacks**: their main goal is not stealing data or making money but simply to create fear and instability.  

While **war motivation** refers to attacks committed by APT groups during wars between two nations.
